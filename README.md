This repository holds the source code of the chapters of the book [3D Game Development with LWJGL 3](https://ahbejarano.gitbook.io/lwjglgamedev/)

## Previous version

Previous version of the book can still be accessed in Github. Here are the links:

* [Book contents](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook-bookcontents-leg)
* [Source code](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook-leg)

**NOTE**: The old version of the book was published, originally, using a different URL. That site is now part of what GitBook considers legacy content. Unfortunately, I cannot access that content any more nor even delete it (according to GitBook this is not possible). Therefore, if you are accessing the book through a GitBook URL which starts with: "https://lwjglgamedev.gitbooks.io/" you are accessing and out of sync version (not even in sync with previous book legacy version which is still hosted in Github).
